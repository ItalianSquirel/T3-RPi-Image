- Pre-installed and pre-configured programming tools, including Python 3, Node.js, NodeRed, PiShrink, RPi Imager, Thonny IDE and all of the NodeRed pallet nodes needed for the T3 Curriculum.
- Automatic network configuration to enable easy access to the Raspberry Pi from other devices on the RPi network.
- Access to the T3 Alliance curriculum and resources.
